• Developed a MaxViT Vision Transformer-based classification model, achieving 99. 2% precision on CT images
for the prediction of chronic kidney disease. Outperformed baseline CNN architectures by extracting advanced
spatial features.
• Utilized TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for the creation, training, and visualization of
end-to-end pipelines
