# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long-term medical condition in which kidney function gradually declines. Early detection of CKD is important to prevent severe complications and improve patient outcomes. This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease using machine learning and deep learning techniques based on medical and clinical data.

The system analyzes patient data and predicts whether a person is affected by CKD or not.

## Objectives

* To predict Chronic Kidney Disease at an early stage
* To analyze medical and clinical data using machine learning models
* To classify patients as CKD or Non-CKD
* To evaluate model performance using standard evaluation metrics

---

## Dataset

* Type: Clinical and medical dataset
* Features include:

  * Age
  * Blood Pressure
  * Blood Glucose
  * Serum Creatinine
  * Hemoglobin
  * Other kidney-related medical parameters
* Source: Publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle)

---

## How the Program Works

1. Patient data is collected from the dataset.
2. Data preprocessing is performed, including handling missing values and normalization.
3. Feature selection is applied to identify important attributes.
4. Machine learning / deep learning models are trained on the processed data.
5. The trained model predicts whether the patient has CKD.
6. Results are evaluated using accuracy and other performance metrics.
